# FireFly

This is a picture sharing app built in a couple of days in a small team with an aim to learning the basics of Swift.  It was built in XCode with Parse as a database.  Both of these technologies were also new to us at the time, so that added to the steep learning curve!

## Getting Started

* You will need XCode installed.  You can get a copy [here](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).
* git clone https://github.com/katylouise/FireFlyApp.git
* Open XCode and find the project.
* Click the play button to view app in the iOS Simulator.

## Learning

* How to create different views in XCode and link these to the code.
* How to create different controller classes for the different views or parts of a view.
* How to use a database to store images.
* How to register users using the Parse database.
